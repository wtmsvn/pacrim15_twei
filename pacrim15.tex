\begin{abstract}
With the enhancement in technology every day there are so many applications being developed every day. There are a lot of applications that have been developed to record presentations and to upload content onto the server for later reference. ThinkTogether is much more than that. Not only does it support basic functions like giving presentation, and adding comments and marking important points, ThinkTogether also provides multilayer function, which achieve better performance by separating different users into multiple layers. As fully functionable as the app already is, we still want to take it to the next level. In this study, we propose a network mechanism using VoIP technology, to introduce voice streaming feature into existing application developed by Two Tall Totems.
