\begin{comment}
With the enhancement in technology every day there are so many applications 
being developed every day. There are a lot of applications that have been 
developed to record presentations and to upload content onto the server for 
later reference. ThinkTogether is much more than that. Not only does it support 
basic functions like giving presentation, and adding comments and marking 
important points, ThinkTogether also provides multilayer function, which achieve 
better performance by separating different users into multiple layers. As fully 
functionable as the app already is, we still want to take it to the next level. 
In this study, we propose a network mechanism using VoIP technology, to 
introduce voice streaming feature into existing application developed by Two 
Tall Totems.
\end{comment}
Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) has been greatly enhanced by 
technology that provides almost real-time capture, replay, and sharing of 
content.   “The cloud” has popularized ease of deployment for apps serviced 
through a centralized approach.  In this work we propose a more aggressive 
design, decentralizing the location of shared content within a peer-to-peer 
structure.  Ease of deployment is maintained through a novel architecture for a 
multilayer distributed cloud.  This paper describes how this approach has shown 
promise in a prototype app, {\em ThinkTogether}, and the potential to enable a 
consistent user experience, even for remote peers sharing VoIP.
