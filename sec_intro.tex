\section{Introduction}

ThinkTogether is a mobile collaboration platform developed by Two Tall Totems, which is also a creative Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) solution. It enables teachers and students to cooperate together through the lecture in a class or presenters and attendees to participate together in a conference. The current implementation of the project on iOS supports the most functionality of the presentation, yet not with voice stream. It is essential to support the voice stream in the application for remote education since students will be able to have a better interaction with the class even if they are not in the classroom. We are going to design and implement a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) based Voice over IP (VoIP) system on the top of the existing application on iOS so that the users not only could actively enjoy the presentation on live but also could store and replay it later on the cloud.

Due to a variety of factors that could affect the quality of service (QoS) for the application, such as limited bandwidth, high volume traffic, network delay and effect of peer signal, we are going to explore and analyze a better solution with optimized performance. This project aims to create a new education model and subvert the traditional way of learning, sharing and communicating with mobile devices through different cutting-edge mobile technology. First of all, we will model a hierarchical architecture, and verify the model as well as the design with a simulation software Omnet++. After that, analysis will be applied to the data collected from the results of the simulation and we are going to discover the bottleneck in our VoIP solution as well as make an improvement.

Therefore, we propose to experiment the method of pushing data among all the devices and ensure the usage of bandwidth that is enough for each user as well as for the cloud server. We are going to implement a stable service based on Voice over IP (VoIP), Peer-to-peer (P2P) or Multi-peer technology, which would also be scalable for large amount users with mobile devices in the existing App. With our partner Two Tall Totems, development on this project with these advanced communication and network technology could greatly change how people think together and help to build a better world.
